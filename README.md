# Integrator
# Romberg integrator
It produces a matrix r of size (n+1,n+1). The entry of r(n+1,n+1) contains accurate solution.

# Composite Trapezoid rule over n intervals, (for just trapezoid, put n = 1)

# Composite Midpoint rule over n intervals, (for just Midpoint, put n = 1)

# Composite Three-point Gaussian over n intervals (for just Three-point Gaussian, put n = 1)

# Composite Simpson's 1/3 rule over n intervals (for just Simpson's 1/3 rule, put n = 1)
